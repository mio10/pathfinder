# Pathfinder

## Description
A CLI program that demonstrates simple pathfinding on a 2D ASCII grid based on [Lee algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_algorithm). I wrote the program in 2017 when I was learning breadth-first search algorithm in University.

## Requirements
PascalABC.NET is required to run.

Other Pascal compilers or IDEs may also work but they weren't tested.

## Quick start
1. Launch PascalABC.NET.
2. Open `pathfinder.pas`.
3. Run the program.

## How to play
1. Build a maze.
2. Set starting and finishing points.
3. Run the pathfinder to see the found path.
